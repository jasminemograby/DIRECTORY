## Inputs Required
- Requirements gathering results
- User workflow definitions
- Integration specifications
- Mock data requirements

## Architecture Design Questions (Ask One at a Time)

### Onion Architecture Layer Design
**Question 1:** How should the Onion Architecture layers be structured for the Directory microservice? Consider domain entities, application services, infrastructure adapters, and presentation components.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Domain Layer: Core business entities and rules (Company, Employee, Trainer, Department, Team)
- Application Layer: Workflow orchestration and use cases
- Infrastructure Layer: Database, external APIs, and internal microservice adapters
- Presentation Layer: React components and API controllers
- Dependency inversion and clean architecture principles

### Database Schema & Multi-Tenancy Design
**Question 2:** How should the PostgreSQL database schema be designed to support multi-tenancy with proper data isolation? Consider company-based partitioning and data relationships.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Company table with tenant isolation
- Employee, Department, Team tables with company_id foreign keys
- Trainer profiles with company-specific permissions
- Training requests and approval workflows
- Audit logging and compliance tracking
- Database indexing and performance optimization

### API Design & REST Endpoints
**Question 3:** What REST API endpoints should be exposed by the Directory microservice? Consider CRUD operations, business workflows, and integration points.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Company management endpoints (registration, updates, hierarchy)
- Employee profile endpoints (CRUD, enrichment, skills)
- Trainer management endpoints (profiles, permissions, content)
- Training request endpoints (creation, approval, tracking)
- Integration endpoints (internal microservices, external APIs)
- Error handling and response standardization

### Mock Data Architecture & Fallback Mechanisms
**Question 4:** How should the mock data system be architected to provide seamless fallback when real APIs are unavailable? Consider data consistency and realistic responses.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Mock data file structure under `/database/mocks/`
- Consistent naming convention (`mock-[feature].json`)
- Realistic data generation and relationships
- Error scenario simulation
- Data validation and schema compliance
- Performance considerations for mock responses

### Integration Architecture & Service Communication
**Question 5:** How should the Directory microservice communicate with the 11 internal microservices and external APIs? Consider REST patterns, error handling, and fallback strategies.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Internal microservice communication patterns
- External API integration strategies
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Circuit breaker patterns for resilience
- Data transformation and mapping
- Authentication and authorization for integrations

### Security Architecture & Data Protection
**Question 6:** How should security be implemented across all layers of the Directory microservice? Consider data encryption, access control, and compliance requirements.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Role-based access control implementation
- API authentication and authorization
- GDPR compliance and data protection
- Audit logging and compliance tracking
- Security monitoring and alerting

### Performance & Scalability Architecture
**Question 7:** How should the Directory microservice be architected for performance and scalability? Consider caching, database optimization, and load handling.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Database query optimization and indexing
- API response caching strategies
- Connection pooling and resource management
- Load balancing and horizontal scaling
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Resource usage and cost optimization

### Deployment Architecture & Infrastructure
**Question 8:** How should the Directory microservice be deployed across Vercel, Railway, and Supabase? Consider environment separation, secrets management, and CI/CD integration.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Frontend deployment to Vercel
- Backend deployment to Railway
- Database hosting on Supabase
- Environment configuration and secrets
- CI/CD pipeline design
- Monitoring and observability setup

### Error Handling & Resilience Architecture
**Question 9:** How should error handling and system resilience be implemented across the Directory microservice? Consider failure scenarios, recovery mechanisms, and user experience.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- API error handling and response standardization
- Database error handling and recovery
- External API failure handling
- User-friendly error messages
- System health monitoring
- Graceful degradation strategies

### Monitoring & Observability Architecture
**Question 10:** How should monitoring, logging, and observability be implemented for the Directory microservice? Consider metrics, alerts, and debugging capabilities.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Application logging and structured logging
- Performance metrics and monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Health checks and system status
- Debugging and troubleshooting tools
- Compliance and audit trail logging

## Confirmation & Summary

After gathering responses to all questions, provide a comprehensive summary including:

1. **Architecture Overview:** Complete system architecture with Onion Architecture layers
2. **Database Design:** Multi-tenant schema with proper relationships and indexing
3. **API Design:** RESTful endpoints with proper error handling and documentation

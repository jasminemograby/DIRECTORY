- Authentication and authorization testing
- Data encryption and protection testing
- Input validation and sanitization testing
- GDPR compliance and data protection testing
- Security vulnerability testing
- Audit logging and compliance testing

### User Interface & Experience Testing
**Question 8:** How should user interface and experience testing be implemented? Consider React component testing, user interaction, and accessibility.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- React component integration testing
- User interaction and behavior testing
- Accessibility and inclusive design testing
- Responsive design and mobile testing
- Performance and rendering testing
- User experience and usability testing

### Error Handling & Recovery Testing
**Question 9:** How should error handling and recovery testing be implemented? Consider failure scenarios, recovery mechanisms, and user experience.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- API error handling and response testing
- Database error and recovery testing
- External service failure testing
- User-friendly error message testing
- Recovery and rollback testing
- System resilience and stability testing

### Production Readiness & Deployment Testing
**Question 10:** How should production readiness and deployment testing be implemented? Consider deployment validation, environment testing, and production monitoring.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Deployment and environment testing
- Production configuration validation
- Monitoring and alerting testing
- Backup and recovery testing
- Performance and stability testing
- User acceptance and validation testing

## Confirmation & Summary

After gathering responses to all questions, provide a comprehensive summary including:

1. **Integration Test Suite:** Complete integration testing for all services and APIs
2. **E2E Test Scenarios:** End-to-end user workflow testing
3. **Mock Data Testing:** Comprehensive mock data and fallback mechanism testing

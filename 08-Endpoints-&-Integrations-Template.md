## Endpoints & Integrations Design Questions (Ask One at a Time)

### Core API Endpoint Design
**Question 1:** How should the core API endpoints be designed for company, employee, and trainer management? Consider RESTful design, request/response schemas, and error handling.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Company management endpoints (CRUD operations)
- Employee profile endpoints (creation, updates, enrichment)
- Trainer management endpoints (profiles, permissions, content)
- RESTful design principles and conventions
- Request/response schema validation
- Error handling and status codes

### Training Request & Workflow Endpoints
**Question 2:** How should training request endpoints be designed for the three request types? Consider creation, approval, tracking, and management workflows.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Training request creation endpoints
- Approval workflow endpoints
- Progress tracking and status updates
- Request history and management
- Integration with approval processes
- Error handling and validation

### Role-Based Access Control Endpoints
**Question 3:** How should role-based access control be implemented in the API endpoints? Consider permission checking, access levels, and security middleware.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Permission-based endpoint access
- Role validation and authorization
- Security middleware implementation
- Access level enforcement
- Audit logging for access control
- Error handling for unauthorized access

### Internal Microservice Integration Endpoints
**Question 4:** How should internal microservice integration endpoints be designed? Consider Auth Service, Skills Engine, Marketplace, and other internal service connections.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Auth Service integration for user verification
- Skills Engine integration for skill normalization
- Marketplace integration for trainer matching
- Content Studio integration for content management
- Course Builder integration for learning feedback
- Analytics and reporting service integration

### External API Integration Endpoints
**Question 5:** How should external API integration endpoints be designed? Consider LinkedIn, GitHub, Credly, and other external data sources with proper error handling.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- LinkedIn profile integration endpoints
- GitHub skills and contribution integration
- Credly certification integration
- YouTube content integration
- ORCID and Crossref academic integration
- Gemini AI bio generation integration

### Mock Data & Fallback Implementation
**Question 6:** How should mock data and fallback mechanisms be implemented for all integrations? Consider realistic responses, error scenarios, and seamless switching.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Mock data response generation
- Fallback mechanism implementation
- Error scenario simulation
- Realistic data relationships
- Performance optimization for mock responses
- Switching between mock and real APIs

### API Documentation & Schema Definition
**Question 7:** How should API documentation and schema definitions be structured? Consider OpenAPI specifications, request/response examples, and developer documentation.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- Request/response schema definitions
- API endpoint documentation
- Error response documentation
- Integration examples and guides
- Developer onboarding documentation

### Error Handling & Response Standardization
**Question 8:** How should error handling and response standardization be implemented across all endpoints? Consider consistent error formats, status codes, and user feedback.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Standardized error response format
- HTTP status code usage
- Error message localization
- User-friendly error descriptions
- Error logging and monitoring
- Recovery and retry mechanisms

### Performance & Optimization Endpoints
**Question 9:** How should performance optimization be implemented in the API endpoints? Consider caching, pagination, and resource optimization.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Response caching strategies
- Pagination and data limiting
- Query optimization and filtering
- Resource usage optimization
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Load balancing and scaling

### Security & Compliance Endpoints
**Question 10:** How should security and compliance be implemented in the API endpoints? Consider authentication, authorization, and audit logging.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- API authentication and authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and security headers
- Audit logging and compliance tracking
- Data encryption and protection
- Security monitoring and alerting

## Confirmation & Summary

After gathering responses to all questions, provide a comprehensive summary including:

1. **API Endpoint Design:** Complete RESTful API design with all endpoints
2. **Integration Architecture:** Internal and external service integration patterns
3. **Mock Data Implementation:** Comprehensive mock data and fallback mechanisms
4. **Error Handling Strategy:** Standardized error handling and response formats
5. **Security Implementation:** Authentication, authorization, and compliance features
6. **Performance Optimization:** Caching, pagination, and resource optimization
7. **API Documentation:** Complete API documentation and schema definitions

## Validation Prompt
**"Do you confirm these endpoint and integration designs are complete and ready for implementation? (Yes/No)"**

If **No:** Refine endpoint designs based on user feedback and repeat confirmation
If **Yes:** Mark endpoint design as complete and proceed to TDD & Unit Tests

## Security & Privacy Considerations
- Implement proper API authentication and authorization
- Design secure endpoints for sensitive employee data
- Plan for audit logging and compliance tracking
- Include input validation and sanitization
- Design secure file upload and data import endpoints

## Responsible AI Considerations
- Plan for ethical AI integration in API endpoints
- Design transparent AI data processing endpoints
- Include user control over AI features and data usage
- Plan for bias detection and mitigation in AI endpoints

- Compliance and regulatory requirements
- Company branding (logo, colors, custom fields)
- KPI definitions and measurement criteria

### Functional Requirements - Employee Data Management
**Question 2:** What employee information needs to be captured and managed? Consider personal details, professional information, skills, and career development data.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Personal information (name, contact, demographics)

- Skills and competencies (current, target, verified)
- Career development (career path, goals, progress)
- Learning history and preferences

### Functional Requirements - Trainer Management
**Question 3:** What specific capabilities and permissions do trainers need? Think about content creation, teaching assignments, and skill verification.

*Follow-up considerations:*

- Teaching assignment and scheduling
- Skill verification and certification
- Performance tracking and feedback

### Functional Requirements - Training Request Workflows
**Question 4:** How should the three training request types (career-path, skill-driven, instructor-led) differ in their workflows and approval processes?

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Career-path training (role-based progression)
- Skill-driven training (competency gaps)
- Instructor-led training (specific course requests)
- Approval workflows and escalation
- Progress tracking and completion criteria

### Functional Requirements - Role-Based Access Control
**Question 5:** What specific permissions and access levels should each role (HR, Manager, Team Lead, Employee) have for viewing and managing data?

*Follow-up considerations:*
- HR Admin permissions (full access, employee management)
- Department Manager permissions (department scope)
- Team Leader permissions (team scope)
- Employee permissions (self-management)
- Inheritance rules and permission conflicts

### Non-Functional Requirements - Performance & Scale
**Question 6:** What are the performance requirements for the Directory microservice? Consider response times, concurrent users, and data volume expectations.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Response time requirements (API calls, page loads)
- Concurrent user expectations
- Data volume and growth projections
- Peak usage scenarios
- Performance degradation thresholds

### Non-Functional Requirements - Security & Compliance
**Question 7:** What security and compliance requirements must the Directory microservice meet? Consider data protection, access control, and audit requirements.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- GDPR compliance requirements
- Data encryption and protection
- Access control and authentication
- Audit logging and compliance reporting
- Data retention and deletion policies

### Integration Requirements - Internal Microservices
**Question 8:** Which internal microservice integrations are most critical for the MVP? Prioritize the 11 integrations based on business value and user workflows.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Auth Service (user verification and roles)
- Skills Engine (skill normalization and verification)
- Marketplace (trainer matching and course discovery)
- Content Studio (content creation and management)
- Course Builder (learning feedback and progress)
- DevLab (exercise provisioning and tracking)
- Learning Analytics (reporting and insights)
- Contextual Corporate Assistant (RAG data provision)
- Assessment (test results and verification)
- SendPulse/SendGrid (notifications and communication)
- Priority ranking and implementation order

### Integration Requirements - External APIs
**Question 9:** Which external API integrations should be prioritized for employee profile enrichment? Consider data quality, availability, and business value.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- LinkedIn (professional profiles and connections)
- GitHub (technical skills and contributions)
- Credly (certifications and achievements)
- YouTube (content creation and expertise)
- ORCID (academic credentials and publications)
- Crossref (research and academic work)
- Gemini API (AI-generated bios and value propositions)
- Data quality and reliability factors
- Fallback strategies for API failures

### Data Requirements - Mock Data Design
**Question 10:** What mock data structures and examples should be created for each integration? Think about realistic data that supports testing and development.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Company and organizational data examples
- Employee profile mock data
- Trainer profile and content examples
- Training request and approval workflows
- External API response mockups
- Error scenarios and edge cases

## Confirmation & Summary

After gathering responses to all questions, provide a comprehensive summary including:

1. **Functional Requirements Summary:** Complete list of features and capabilities
2. **Non-Functional Requirements:** Performance, security, and compliance requirements
3. **Integration Priorities:** Ranked list of internal and external integrations
4. **Mock Data Strategy:** Comprehensive mock data design for all integrations
5. **User Story Mapping:** Complete user stories for all roles and workflows
6. **Data Requirements:** Detailed data models and relationships

## Validation Prompt
**"Do you confirm these requirements are complete and accurate before proceeding to architecture design? (Yes/No)"**

If **No:** Refine requirements based on user feedback and repeat confirmation
If **Yes:** Mark requirements gathering as complete and proceed to Architecture Decision

## Security & Privacy Considerations
- Document all PII handling requirements
- Define data encryption and protection needs
- Plan for GDPR compliance and user consent
- Identify audit logging and compliance reporting requirements
- Design data retention and deletion policies

## Responsible AI Considerations

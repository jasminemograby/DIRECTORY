### Environment Management & Configuration
**Question 7:** How should different environments be managed and configured? Consider development, staging, and production environments.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Environment-specific configurations
- Database and service configurations
- Feature flags and environment variables
- Environment promotion and deployment
- Testing and validation procedures
- Environment monitoring and management

### Deployment Monitoring & Observability
**Question 8:** How should deployment monitoring and observability be implemented? Consider health checks, monitoring, and alerting.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Health checks and monitoring
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Error tracking and alerting
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Uptime monitoring and SLA tracking
- Incident response and notification

### Rollback & Recovery Procedures
**Question 9:** How should rollback and recovery procedures be implemented? Consider deployment rollback, data recovery, and incident response.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Deployment rollback procedures
- Database rollback and recovery
- Data backup and restoration
- Incident response and recovery
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Business continuity planning

### Production Readiness & Go-Live Procedures
**Question 10:** How should production readiness and go-live procedures be implemented? Consider final validation, deployment, and monitoring.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Production readiness checklist
- Final validation and testing
- Go-live procedures and coordination
- Production monitoring and support
- User communication and training
- Post-deployment validation and support

## Confirmation & Summary

After gathering responses to all questions, provide a comprehensive summary including:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflows:** Complete CI/CD pipeline with all necessary workflows
2. **Vercel Deployment:** Frontend deployment configuration and optimization
3. **Railway Deployment:** Backend deployment configuration and scaling
4. **Supabase Deployment:** Database deployment and migration configuration
5. **Secrets Management:** Comprehensive secrets and environment variable management
6. **CI/CD Integration:** Automated testing, quality gates, and deployment
7. **Environment Management:** Multi-environment configuration and management
8. **Monitoring & Observability:** Comprehensive monitoring and alerting setup
9. **Rollback Procedures:** Complete rollback and recovery procedures

# 09 - Test-Driven Development & Unit Tests Template

## Description
This template sets up comprehensive testing framework with Jest, creates failing tests for all features, and establishes TDD workflow for the Directory microservice with proper test coverage and quality assurance.

## What This Template Produces
- Test framework configuration
- Failing test suites
- Test data fixtures
- TDD workflow documentation
- Coverage reporting setup

## Inputs Required
- Endpoint and integration designs
- Data model specifications
- Feature design requirements
- Architecture design decisions

## TDD Setup Questions (Ask One at a Time)

### Testing Framework & Configuration
**Question 1:** How should the testing framework be configured for the Directory microservice? Consider Jest setup, test utilities, and testing environment configuration.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Jest configuration for unit and integration tests
- Test environment setup and configuration
- Testing utilities and helper functions
- Mock and stub configuration
- Test data fixtures and factories
- Coverage reporting and thresholds

### Unit Test Design & Implementation
**Question 2:** How should unit tests be designed for all core functionality? Consider domain entities, business logic, and service layer testing.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Domain entity testing (Company, Employee, Trainer)
- Business logic and service layer testing
- Utility function and helper testing
- Data validation and transformation testing
- Error handling and edge case testing
- Mock data and fixture testing

### Integration Test Design & Implementation
**Question 3:** How should integration tests be designed for API endpoints and database operations? Consider end-to-end workflows and service integration testing.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- API endpoint integration testing
- Database operation and migration testing
- Service integration and communication testing
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Error handling and recovery testing
- Performance and load testing

### Mock Data & Test Fixtures
**Question 4:** How should mock data and test fixtures be structured for comprehensive testing? Consider realistic test data, edge cases, and error scenarios.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Test data factories and builders
- Mock external API responses
- Database seed data for testing
- Error scenario test data
- Performance testing data sets
- Integration testing mockups

### TDD Workflow & Best Practices
**Question 5:** How should the TDD workflow be established for the Directory microservice? Consider failing test creation, code implementation, and refactoring cycles.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Failing test creation and validation
- Code implementation to pass tests
- Refactoring and code improvement
- Test coverage and quality metrics
- Continuous integration and testing
- Code review and quality assurance

### Frontend Component Testing
**Question 6:** How should frontend component testing be implemented? Consider React component testing, user interaction testing, and UI validation.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- React component unit testing
- User interaction and behavior testing
- UI component integration testing
- Accessibility testing and validation
- Responsive design testing
- Performance and rendering testing

### Backend Service Testing
**Question 7:** How should backend service testing be implemented? Consider Express route testing, middleware testing, and service layer validation.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Express route and endpoint testing
- Middleware and authentication testing
- Service layer and business logic testing
- Database integration and ORM testing
- Error handling and exception testing
- Performance and load testing

### External API Integration Testing
**Question 8:** How should external API integration testing be implemented? Consider mock API testing, error handling, and fallback mechanism validation.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- External API mock testing
- Integration error handling testing
- Fallback mechanism validation
- Data transformation and mapping testing
- Performance and timeout testing
- Security and authentication testing

### Test Coverage & Quality Metrics
**Question 9:** How should test coverage and quality metrics be implemented? Consider coverage thresholds, quality gates, and continuous monitoring.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Test coverage thresholds and targets
- Quality gates and acceptance criteria
- Continuous monitoring and reporting
- Performance benchmarking and metrics
- Security testing and vulnerability assessment
- Code quality and maintainability metrics

### CI/CD Integration & Automation
**Question 10:** How should testing be integrated with CI/CD pipelines? Consider automated testing, quality gates, and deployment validation.

*Follow-up considerations:*
- Automated test execution in CI/CD
- Quality gates and deployment criteria
- Test result reporting and notification
- Performance testing in CI/CD
- Security testing and vulnerability scanning
- Rollback and recovery testing

## Confirmation & Summary

After gathering responses to all questions, provide a comprehensive summary including:

1. **Testing Framework Setup:** Complete Jest configuration with all necessary tools and utilities
2. **Unit Test Suite:** Comprehensive unit tests for all core functionality
3. **Integration Test Suite:** End-to-end integration tests for all workflows
